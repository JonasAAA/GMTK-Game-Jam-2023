Mass and velocity should be from 0 to 100 when supplied to Wwise

NEED to have:
* viarious size asteroids
* damage the spaceship
* calculate score
* allow player to move asteroids

The spaceship should be just a regular physics body, but with some rudimentary AI, which tries to make it look forward and have some particular speed
The asteroids should have on average 0 speed, so that if spaceship is fast it feels so.

MAY NEED to keep spaceship position under control. Probably just apply forces to everything so that spaceship position is around 0
OR could loop though all asteroids and manually set their positions (careful - should only set some helper variables, and use them in _integrate_forces)

RigidBody2D seems to be what I want most game objects to be

Will probably need rocket coordinates to be (0, 0) all the time as otherwise may get imprecise behaviour when all coordinates are large

MAY need to use KinematicBody2D instead of RigidBody2D to get more control of how things work, e.g. be able to keep rocket coordinates at (0, 0)
